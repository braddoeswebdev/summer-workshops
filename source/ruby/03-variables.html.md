# Variables

So far, whenever we have `puts`ed a string or a number, the thing we `puts`ed is gone. What I mean is, if we wanted to print something out twice, we would have to type it in twice:

~~~~ ruby
puts '...you can say that again...'
puts '...you can say that again...'
~~~~

~~~~ text
...you can say that again...
...you can say that again...
~~~~

It would be nice if we could just type it in once and then hang on to it... store it somewhere. Well, we can, of course â€” otherwise, I wouldn't have brought it up!

To store the string in your computer's memory, we need to give the string a name. Programmers often refer to this process as assignment, and they call the names variables. This variable can be just about any sequence of letters and numbers, but the first character needs to be a lowercase letter. Let's try that last program again, but this time I will give the string the name `myString` (though I could just as well have named it `str` or  `myOwnLittleString` or `henryTheEighth`).

~~~~ ruby
myString = '...you can say that again...'
puts myString
puts myString
~~~~

~~~~ text
...you can say that again...
...you can say that again...
~~~~

Whenever you tried to do something to `myString`, the program did it to `'...you can say that again...'` instead. You can think of the variable `myString` as "pointing to" the string  `'...you can say that again...'`. Here's a slightly more interesting example:

~~~~ ruby
name = 'Patricia Rosanna Jessica Mildred Oppenheimer'
puts 'My name is ' + name + '.'
puts 'Wow!  ' + name + ' is a really long name!'
~~~~

~~~~ text
My name is Patricia Rosanna Jessica Mildred Oppenheimer.
Wow!  Patricia Rosanna Jessica Mildred Oppenheimer is a really long name!
~~~~

Also, just as we can assign an object to a variable, we can reassign a different object to that variable. (This is why we call them variables: because what they point to can vary.)

~~~~ ruby
composer = 'Mozart'
puts composer + ' was "da bomb", in his day.'

composer = 'Beethoven'
puts 'But I prefer ' + composer + ', personally.'
~~~~

~~~~ text
Mozart was "da bomb", in his day.
But I prefer Beethoven, personally.
~~~~

Of course, variables can point to any kind of object, not just strings:

~~~~ ruby
var = 'just another ' + 'string'
puts var

var = 5 * (1+2)
puts var
~~~~

~~~~ text
just another string
15
~~~~

In fact, variables can point to just about anything... except other variables. So what happens if we try?

~~~~ ruby
var1 = 8
var2 = var1
puts var1
puts var2

puts ''

var1 = 'eight'
puts var1
puts var2
~~~~

~~~~ text
8
8

eight
8
~~~~

So first, when we tried to point `var2` to `var1`, it really pointed to 8 instead (just like `var1` was pointing to). Then we had `var1` point to  'eight', but since `var2` was never really pointing at `var1`, it stays pointing at 8.

So now that we've got variables, numbers, and strings, let's learn how to mix them all up!
