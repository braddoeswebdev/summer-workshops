# Getting Started

So, you're ready to start building some electronics circuits.  Here's what you need to do to get started.

* Verify that your kit has all the parts - check the list in the bag.
* Attach the Teensy microcontroller to the breadboard and add wires approximately as shown. The color of the wires doesn't matter.  Remember, all the holes in each row are connected together, so it doesn't matter which hole in the row you plug the wire into on yours.

* Connect the Teensy to your computer with the MicroUSB cable.  If everything's working, the little yellow LED on the Teensy should start blinking.
