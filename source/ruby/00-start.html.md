# Getting Started

When you program a computer, you have to "speak" in a language your computer understands: a programming language. There are lots and lots of different languages out there, and many of them are excellent. In this tutorial I chose to use my favorite programming language, *Ruby*.

Aside from being my favorite, Ruby is also the easiest programming language I have seen (and I've seen quite a few). In fact, that's the real reason I'm writing this tutorial: I didn't decide to write a tutorial, and then choose Ruby because it's my favorite; instead, I found Ruby to be so easy that I decided there really ought to be a good beginner's tutorial which uses it. It's Ruby's simplicity which prompted this tutorial, not the fact that it's my favorite. (Writing a similar tutorial using another language, like C++ or Java, would have required hundreds and hundreds of pages.) But don't think that Ruby is a beginner's language just because it is easy! It is a powerful, professional-strength programming language if ever there was one.

When you write something in a human language, what is written is called text. When you write something in a computer language, what is written is called code. I have included lots of examples of Ruby code throughout this tutorial, most of them complete programs you can run on your own computer. When you see an example, type it for yourself to try it out.  If you copy and paste the code, you won't learn as much.
