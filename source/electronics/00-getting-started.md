# Getting Started

So, you're ready to start building some electronics circuits.  Here's what you need to do to get started.

* Verify that your kit has all the parts - check the list in the bag.
* Attach the Teensy microcontroller to the breadboard and add wires as shown (the color of the wires doesn't really matter).

* Connect the Teensy to your computer with the MicroUSB cable.  If everything's working, the little yellow LED on the Teensy should start blinking.

Congratulations, you're ready to start building circuits!  Click the "next" link in the lower right to continue.
