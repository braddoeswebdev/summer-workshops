# Planning & Designing

Before you do anything, you need some ideas. What should your website actually do? A website can do basically anything, but for your first try you should keep things simple. We'll start by creating a simple webpage with a heading, an image, and a few paragraphs.

To begin with, you'll need to answer these questions:

- What is your website about? Do you like dogs, New York, or Pacman?
- What information are you presenting on the subject? Type up a title and 2-3 short paragraphs, and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.
- What does your website look like, in simple high-level terms. What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle?

Next, get a pen and paper and sketch out roughly how you want your site to look. For your first simple webpage, there's not much to sketch out, but you should get in the habit of doing this now. It really helps--you don't have to be a Van Gogh!

## Choosing your Assets
At this point, it's good to start putting together the content & assets that will eventually appear on your webpage.  *Content* is the actual information that will be displayed on your page.  *Assets* are all the other stuff - images, colors, fonts, and the other pieces that help your page look good.

### Color Theme

Head over to [paletton.com](http://paletton.com/) to pick out a color scheme.  Paletton will help you pick colors that will look good together.  You'll need to copy down the color codes for any colors you want to use, which you can get by hovering your mouse over a color on the right side of the screen.

### Images

To choose an image, go to [Google Images](https://www.google.com/imghp?gws_rd=ssl) and search for something suitable.

- When you find the image you want, click on the image.
- Press the View image button.
- On the next page, right-click the image, choose Save image as, and choose a safe place to save your image.

### Fonts

To choose a font:

- Go to [Google Fonts](http://google.com/fonts) and scroll down the list until you find one you like. You can also use the controls on the left to further filter the results.
- Click the Add to collection button next to the font you want.
- Click the Use button in the panel at the bottom of the page.
- On the next page, scroll down to sections 3 and 4, and copy the lines of code Google gives you into your text editor to save for later.
